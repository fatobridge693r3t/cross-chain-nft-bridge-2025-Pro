## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that touches on a common point of confusion in the crypto space: the difference between **decentralized protocols** and **centralized exchanges (CEXs)**.

Let's be clear: a **cross-chain NFT bridge** does **not** directly integrate with major CEXs like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management in the way you might be thinking.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why, followed by the *actual* relationship and how these technologies can work together in a broader, more automated strategy.

### The Core Misconception: Decentralized vs. Centralized

1.  **Cross-Chain NFT Bridges are Decentralized Protocols:**
    *   They operate on blockchain networks (like Ethereum, Solana, Polygon) using smart contracts.
    *   Their purpose is to enable the **trustless transfer of NFTs** between different, otherwise isolated, blockchains.
    *   **Example:** Using a bridge to move a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT from Ethereum to the faster/cheaper Polygon blockchain.

2.  **Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) are Walled Gardens:**
    *   Platforms like Binance
